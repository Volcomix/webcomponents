Notes:
Quick intro about my self then say: "I like to learn about other libraries/frameworks or other practices, and by the way the standard way to do tricky stuf in vanilla.js. That's a good way to learn what are other standards, how others develop, and gives inspiration and new ideas to use the right solution to a given problem".

Notes:
I have a personal project to do something that looks like that. A node editor seems to me like a good way to visualize and synthesize sound. I code it in Vue.js.

[BooMyLife]

Notes:
A friend of mine do that. This is a home automation software, and the node editor also sounds good here to plug stuffs. He codes it in React.

Notes:
And I also have this one. It's a bot to automate trading and the node editor looks good to schedule the bot tasks and their dependencies. I code it in Angular (Actually, this is not true - it is also in React - but that's just to make my point!).

Notes:
What choice do you have?

---

[Material Design]

Notes:
You can write a spec...

---

[Material-UI]

Notes:
Implement it 3 times...

---

[Vuetify]

Notes:
With different implementation and inconsistent decisions...

---

[Angular Material]

Notes:
And one implementation which is out of date regarding the last version of the spec.

---

[Bootstrap]

Notes:
Or you can create a library using JQuery...

---

WIP

Notes:
And create one wrapper per framework

...

---

[Stencil/Ionic]

Notes:
Or you can develop your components only once, and use it directly with you favorite library/framework (Angular, React, Vue), with almost nothing to do (minimal config to get the Web Components)

---

# Web Components

Notes:
This last solution is called Web Components

You might have heard about them for a long time, they have been around for a while.

Who already heard about Web Components?
Who know the basis of how to use it or how it works?
(Who already used it? => Actually maybe all of you already used them! ==> Check if Angular expose web components)
Who already developed Web Components?

You probably won't develop Web Component in a near future but having a quick background on it can help you designing good components with today frameworks, and also to know what is standard js vs what value is added by the framework.
